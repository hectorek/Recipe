Directions
==========

Let's get started! We can get this done in three simple stages:

* :ref:`Preparation stage <prepstage>`
* :ref:`Cooking stage <cookingstage>`
* :ref:`Plating stage <platingstage>`

.. _prepstage:

Preparation Stage
-----------------

* 1- Peel the potatoes and cut them into 5mm slices.
* 2- Peel and chop the onion.
* 3- Whisk the eggs in the bowl and add a pinch of salt. Put it aside.

Cooking Stage
-------------

Pour the olive oil in the large frying pan and, once it is hot, add the potatoes together with the onion.
Sprinkle a generous amount of salt over them. Turn them around periodically until
the potatoes begin to turn golden-brown. With the help of your spatula, gently break
the potatoes into smaller pieces. Once they are ready, begin to collect them, letting the excess oil
drain back into the pan, and transfer them to the bowl we had previously set aside. Integrate them with the eggs.

Plating Stage
-------------

Clean up the frying pan or bring in the one you were reserving for this stage.
Pour a little oil - just about enough to prevent the omelette from sticking to the pan.
Once it is hot, add in your potato and egg mix. As it starts to cook, use the
spatula to round in the edges - this will help us obtain the desired shape and
prevent it from spilling when we flip it around. Once the lower side seems to be
done, place a large plate over the frying pan, hold it, and turn the pan around.
Gently return the omelette to the frying pan, making sure nothing is left on the plate.
While the other side sears up, wipe the plate with a piece of kitchen paper.
Once the omelette is ready, place the plate on top and repeat the process to take it out.


Let cool and, as the french say, *bone apple teeth*!
